The provided code is a response to the Data Analytics Challenge within the TVS E.P.I.C Challenge organized by TVS Credit. The challenge's central objective is to leverage analytics and data science methodologies to identify customers with a heightened risk of defaulting on Personal Loans (PL). This initiative aligns with TVS Credit's goal to mitigate risks associated with the most vulnerable customer segments. The code employs various steps, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and the implementation of classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression. The ultimate model, utilizing the Gradient Boosting algorithm, achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.87%, showcasing its efficacy in identifying and managing potential loan default risks for TVS Credit.
